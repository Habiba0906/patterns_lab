# On Patterns Lab

An interactive web-based exploration of how statistical structure can produce misleading patterns in data.

This project uses simple simulations to examine:
- Signal and noise
- Temporal memory (autocorrelation)
- Structural and spurious correlation

The goal is not prediction, but to build intuition and skepticism when interpreting data-driven patterns.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Running Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
